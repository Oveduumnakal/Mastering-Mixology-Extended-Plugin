/**
 * Recommends the delivery that gives the most useful resin per potion over the long run.
 *
 * <p>Every non-empty subset of the three orders is a possible delivery. Its useful resin is the resin it gives,
 * including the +20% (two orders) or +40% (three orders) batch bonus, with each colour capped at what is still needed
 * for the target. Each colour's resin is then weighted by the cube of its deficit relative to the largest one: the
 * colour furthest behind takes longest to finish, so its resin is worth the most, and the steep weighting keeps the
 * other colours from finishing early and wasting resin. The exponent 3 was the fastest of 0.5 to 10 in simulation.
 * Delivering refreshes all three orders, so each potion brewed now has an opportunity cost: the
 * useful resin per potion the player can expect from future order sets. That rate is found by Dinkelbach iteration
 * over every possible order set, weighted by the in-game order chances, and the delivery that beats it by the most
 * wins.
 *
 * <p>Time is counted in average potions. Each delivery also costs {@link #DEPOSIT_COST} potions of time for the walk
 * to the conveyor belt and the start of the next set. Every choice includes exactly one delivery, so this cost does
 * not change the comparison within one order set; it lowers the long-run rate, which makes extra potions in the
 * current set worth brewing more often. When the orders' modifiers are known, each potion in the current set costs its
 * station's time (see {@link #potionCost(PotionModifier)}); future sets use the average.
 *
 * <p>A digweed doubles one potion's resin, and the batch bonus applies to the doubled amount. Potions it already
 * improved count double, and each digweed the player holds goes on the slot of a delivery where it adds the most
 * useful resin, so an order worth brewing only with a digweed gets recommended. Future sets assume no digweed.
